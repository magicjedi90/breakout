//! Scene-driven brick layouts.
//!
//! The brick grid is authored in `assets/scenes/level1.scene.ron` (editable
//! in the engine editor) and instantiated at every match start. Bricks are
//! identified by the `brick_r{row}_c{col}` naming convention; the row digit
//! drives the score payout, which stays a game rule in Rust
//! (`spawning::brick_value`). If the scene is missing or yields no bricks,
//! the caller falls back to the generated grid in `spawning::spawn_bricks`.
